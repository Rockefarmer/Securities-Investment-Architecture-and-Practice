II. Investing Wisdom from Zhuangzi’s “Free and Easy Wandering”

The text of Xiaoyao you ("Free and Easy Wandering") fully expresses Zhuangzi's philosophical ideas, namely nihilism and absolute freedom. It emphasizes comprehending human existence from the perspective of the cosmos, freeing oneself from a narrow mindset of complacency and self-limitation, and allowing the human spirit to transcend reality (Hansen, 2014; Ziporyn, 2020).

1. As for one who rides the true course of Heaven and Earth and masters the changes of the six elemental energies, to wander in the infinite, what does such a one have to rely upon? Therefore: the Perfect Person has no self; the Spirit-like Person has no merit; the Sage has no fame.

"Free and Easy Wandering" proposes the ultimate state of personal cultivation: following the inherent nature of all things in heaven and earth, mastering the transformations of the six energies, and roaming in the boundless realm, free of hunger for reputation or credit (Legge, trans., Xiaoyao you, §3; Watson, 1996, pp. 23–27). The line often appears as: “The Perfect Man has no self; the Spirit-like Man has no merit; the Sage has no fame” (Watson, 1996, p. 26). The idea for investors: keep ego and scoreboard thinking from steering your process; align with how markets actually work rather than with how you wish they would. 

2. “If the whole world praised him, he wouldn’t be more eager; if the whole world blamed him, he wouldn’t be disheartened—he drew a clear line between internal and external, and knew where honor and disgrace really lie.”

Zhuangzi uses Song Rongzi to picture steadiness: applause doesn’t make him strain; blame doesn’t make him wilt. He “fixes the boundary between what is within (his own heart-mind) and what is without, and discerns the line between true honor and disgrace” (Legge, trans., Xiaoyao you, §3; cf. Watson, 1996, pp. 25–26). The distinction between internal and external refers to the relationship between oneself and the objective world—whether one uses wealth or is driven by it. If a person lives their life as a slave to money, exhausting their whole life merely moving wealth around, the end is inevitably desolate. More tragically, this process leads to a loss of self and the loss of the ability to rationally analyze and judge the objective world. This is lamentable, both in life and in investment.

The core of discerning honor and disgrace, and distinguishing internal from external, is knowing oneself, determining the proper measure for dealing with oneself and external things, and clearly understanding the boundaries of honor and disgrace. When you propose a viewpoint, do you feel more powerful if others support you? Do you feel like a failure if others oppose you? Unfortunately, right is right and wrong is wrong; they do not change because of the emotions of the crowd. Therefore, an investment decision is not correct simply because the majority agrees with it, nor because an important figure endorses it. An investment is correct only if its assumptions are correct, the facts it relies on are correct, and its reasoning is sound. Only by relying on knowledge and reasoning can one achieve conservative investment.
