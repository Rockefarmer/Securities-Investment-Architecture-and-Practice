Preface to the English & Open-Source Edition (2025)

This edition brings Building Securities Investment Systems: Architecture and Practice to a wider audience and to a new medium. It is written for practitioners, researchers, and students who want to design investable workflows rather than treat models as black boxes.

Compared with earlier versions, this edition is open and reproducible. The book is serialized on GitHub with working code and lightweight datasets. Readers can clone the repository, run the notebooks, and submit issues or pull requests to improve content and code.

A note from my current research. I am pursuing an MSc (thesis-based) in Electrical & Computer Engineering (Software Engineering stream) at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario. My research focuses on forecasting stock trend and fundamental KPI like revenue using ARIMA/SARIMA, LSTM, and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) models with fundamental and market features. That work—data pipelines, feature engineering, careful train/validation/test protocols, and transparent evaluation—directly informs this book’s emphasis on engineering practice, reproducibility, and honest model assessment. I’m grateful to my supervisor and the faculty for their guidance and to classmates for many spirited discussions.

This book also records my own learning path—from the early fascination with markets to practical roles in research and portfolio work. Those experiences, and the mentors who shaped them, are described in more detail in the Preface to the Second Edition (2022) and Preface to the First Edition (2020) that follow. Here, I focus on what matters now: making ideas executable and auditable.
