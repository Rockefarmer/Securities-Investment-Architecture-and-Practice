IV. The Investment Wisdom of The Art of War
The Art of War was written by Sun Wu, a general from the state of Wu during the Spring and Autumn period. Its thirteen chapters, totaling about six thousand characters, are a brilliant treasure of ancient Chinese military culture and the world's earliest military treatise (Sawyer, 1994).

1. Pursue a High Probability of Winning; Avoid Battles You Aren't Sure Of
The opening of "Initial Estimations" states: "Warfare is the greatest affair of state, the basis of life and death, the Way [Dao] to survival or extinction. It must be thoroughly investigated" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 157). "Estimations" (Ji) means calculation. It emphasizes thorough preparation before battle, conducting detailed research, and meticulously calculating the probability of victory or defeat. Avoid fights you aren't confident in winning. "Thus, one who calculates extensively before battle will win; one who calculates minimally will not win, how much less so one who calculates not at all!" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 161). In investing, the work should be done upfront, constantly seeking investment opportunities with a high probability of profit. If you can add a significant margin of safety, the chance of making money increases greatly. Your investment profit or loss is essentially determined the moment you place the order.
"Therefore, structure it according to the five factors [Dao, Heaven, Earth, Generals, Military Laws] and evaluate it through estimations to seek their true nature" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 158). The Art of War stresses using the "Five Factors" and "Seven Estimations" to judge the probability of victory and conduct a self-check for "knowing victory." The "Five Factors and Seven Estimations" involve comprehensively and accurately calculating the strength disparity and advantages/disadvantages between yourself and the enemy, analyzing the odds of winning. If the probability is high, mobilize forces; if it's low, perhaps abandon the fight or passively wait for a better opportunity. In investing, this is akin to the analytical framework of "top-down analysis across three horizontals, two verticals, and six factors."
Sun Wu proposed the personality standards of "Wisdom, Trustworthiness, Benevolence, Courage, and Strictness." "Wisdom" is being resourceful, knowing when to adapt and be flexible. "Trustworthiness" means clear rewards and punishments, fostering implicit trust. "Benevolence" is caring for your people as your children. "Courage" is decisiveness and moving forward boldly. "Strictness" is strictly enforcing military discipline. For a professional investor, Wisdom comes first: having rigorous logic, discovering opportunities, waiting patiently for the right moment, and completing the overall capital deployment. Trustworthiness means building a reputation, having confidence in your investment targets, and having the courage to admit your mistakes. Benevolence means treating your investors' money as your own. Courage is decisiveness and execution; don't hesitate and miss the opportunity. Strictness means strictly adhering to investment discipline and logic.
As a former leader said: "A successful investor has six traits: First is mindset; masters are those who remain unruffled. Second is reverence for the market; you must understand risk and take it seriously. Third is rationality; you must possess the relevant background knowledge and be able to control your emotions. Fourth is constant evolution; you must be able to correct mistakes. Fifth is focus; successful investors often lead monotonous lives. Sixth is decisiveness; plan first, then act."

2. Position Yourself Invincibly; Secure Victory Before Fighting
"Know the enemy and know yourself, and in a hundred battles you will never be in peril" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 168). Knowing the "enemy" (the market) is hard, but knowing "yourself" is even harder. You must know your own character weaknesses or strengths and improve or optimize them. Your investment and trading style must match your personality; this naturally improves your win rate.
"In antiquity those skilled in warfare first made themselves invincible and then awaited the enemy's vulnerability. Invincibility lies with yourself; vulnerability lies with the enemy... Thus, those skilled in warfare can make themselves invincible, but cannot cause an enemy to be certainly vulnerable. Thus, it is said: 'Victory can be known but cannot be made'" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 165). The strategic decisions in The Art of War are extremely conservative. First, defend yourself so tightly that you present an invincible posture, then wait for the opportunity to attack the enemy. Whether you can be defeated is up to you. Whether you can defeat the enemy depends on whether they make a mistake. Therefore, skilled warriors focus on strengthening their defense and ensuring they make no mistakes; they cannot force the enemy to err. Thus, victory is about waiting, not forceful action. If the enemy is impregnable, we cannot win. What can we do then? Only wait. Wait for what? Wait for the opponent to make a mistake, wait for the situation to change. Sun Wu believed waiting is the best strategy; it's more important than attacking. Similarly, in investing, first strengthen your defense—don't make mistakes—and patiently wait for the market to make a mistake, for stocks to become significantly undervalued. When the opportunity appears, strike forcefully. Whether you lose money in investing depends on yourself; ensure you make no mistakes. You cannot make the market err; all we can do is wait, patiently for the market to slip up. Charlie Munger said investing is a two-step process: first, thoroughly research the company; second, wait for them to plummet.
"Thus, one who excels at warfare establishes himself in a position where he cannot be defeated and does not miss [any opportunity] to defeat the enemy. For this reason, the victorious army first realizes the conditions for victory and then seeks to do battle. The defeated army fights first and then seeks victory" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 166). An investor is like a resourceful, bold-yet-cautious general commanding a powerful "invincible" army. Once the stock market shows the volatile "vulnerable" trend, he acts decisively without missing the timing. For example, after thoroughly researching a stock, you wait. Wait for the market to make a mistake, so the moment you strike, you are highly likely to make money. However, most investors are in a hurry to buy first, then hold the stock, wishfully hoping the market moves as they imagine, often ending up with heavy losses. "The key to investing is not a lot of action, but a great deal of patience. You must stick to your principles, and when the opportunity comes, attack heavily."
"In antiquity those who were skilled in warfare conquered those who were easy to conquer..." "Thus, the method for employing the military: if ten times the enemy's strength, surround them; if five times, attack them; if double, divide them; if equal, be able to engage them; if fewer, be able to evade them; if not as good, be able to avoid them" (Sawyer, 1994, pp. 178-179). The Art of War is not about winning against odds; it's about winning with superior strength. Sun Wu believed skilled warriors don't rely on risky, against-the-odds victories, but achieve localized, overwhelming superiority in multiple engagements, winning effortlessly, even making it seem mundane. Furthermore, facing unfavorable odds, Sun Wu would swiftly retreat and later win through wiser methods. In investing, I often require myself only to pursue investments where making money is like picking up money off the ground—earning reasonable profits easily and ordinarily, without seeking thrills or heart-pounding action. When facing an unfavorable situation, be able to exit the trade safely and quickly. Many investors fantasize about winning against odds, leveraging small sums for big gains, hoping for quick doubles and overnight wealth, ultimately often losing their capital and returning in defeat.

3. Defensive Counterattack; Hold the Risk Bottom Line
"Thus, one who does not fully know the harms of employing the army cannot fully know the advantages of employing the army" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 177). In investing, "advantages" are mostly icing on the cake, while "harms" can be fatal mistakes. Therefore, hold the risk bottom line. Charlie Munger said, "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there." No matter the time or place, first ensure you survive, so you have the chance to face tomorrow's battle and win the next fight.
"Thus, in warfare, value quick victory, not prolonged engagement" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 172). Commanding troops requires achieving victory quickly; prolonged delays drain your elite soldiers and reduce combat effectiveness. In investing, minimize waiting time and quickly move away from your cost basis.
"One who excels at defense hides himself below the ninefold earth; one who excels at offense moves above the ninefold heavens. Thus, he is able to preserve himself and achieve complete victory" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 181). Speed is crucial in war. When selling stocks and withdrawing funds, hide the money completely, resisting market temptations. When deploying funds to buy stocks, enter precisely like a divine soldier descending from heaven. Most people, facing short-term losses, refuse to sell, clinging to hope or unwilling to admit mistakes, even averaging down against the trend, ultimately getting trapped for years in deep losses, suffering greatly.

4. Though You Have Wisdom, Seek It Through Momentum, Riding and Borrowing Momentum
"The force [shi] of swiftly flowing water is such that it can carry boulders... Thus, one who excels at warfare seeks [victory] through the strategic configuration of power [shi] and does not demand it from his men... Thus, the shi of one who excels at warfare is like a round stone rolling down a thousand-fathom mountain. This is shi" (Sawyer, 1994, pp. 168-169). The reason torrential water can move massive rocks is its immense kinetic energy derived from momentum. Therefore, skilled warriors not only pursue a favorable "momentum" but also create their own "momentum," like a round rock rolling down an immensely high, steep mountain—irresistible and overwhelming.

5. In Battle, Use the Normal Force to Engage, the Extraordinary to Win
"In general, in battle one engages with the normal force [zheng] and gains victory through the extraordinary [qi]. Thus, one who is good at employing the extraordinary is as inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth, as unlimited as the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 184). In war, divide your troops. The main force is the normal force (zheng), a smaller part is the extraordinary force (qi), i.e., the reserves. In investing, there are two interpretations: (1) Stocks are the "normal force," the main force for preserving and increasing asset value. Cash is the "extraordinary force." Always keep highly liquid cash on hand. Only when the market is extremely fearful and selling off mistakenly can you seize the opportunity to go all-in. (2) Use large positions for value/growth investments with broad prospects, rapid development, and clear upward price trends. Use small positions to attack mainstream hot sectors within your circle of competence, using guerrilla tactics—if you win, run; if you can't win, also run.
"Warfare is the Way [Dao] of deception" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 161). The stock market is like a battlefield, full of deceptions and counter-human nature. We must remain constantly vigilant, analyze market fluctuations rationally, and control risks well.
"Thus, the army does not have any constant strategic configuration of power [shi]; water does not have any constant shape. One who is able to change and transform in accord with the enemy and achieve victory is termed 'spiritual' [shen]" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 185). In commanding troops, one must make decisions based on changes in the enemy's situation, adapting to change in order to seek advantage and avoid harm, winning cleverly. In stock investing, pay close attention to market dynamics. If the market changes, I change. Adapting is more important than predicting.

6. Manage Emotions, Maintain Composure, Suppress Impulses
"The ruler cannot mobilize the army out of anger; the general cannot engage in battle out of irritation. Act when it is advantageous; desist when it is not. Anger can revert to joy, irritation can revert to delight, but a vanquished state cannot be revived, the dead cannot be brought back to life. Thus, the enlightened ruler is cautious about it, the good general is alert to it. This is the Way to secure the state and preserve the army intact" (Sawyer, 1994, p. 191). Investors must constantly manage their emotions. Extreme panic and extreme optimism will eventually subside, but the loss of principal from rash investments can never be recovered. As someone once aptly described: "A person's failure lies not in misjudging the market trend, but in their mindset. When the mind is in disarray and eyes are red [with greed or panic], they won't stop until defeated on the battlefield. This has nothing to do with IQ or technique."
