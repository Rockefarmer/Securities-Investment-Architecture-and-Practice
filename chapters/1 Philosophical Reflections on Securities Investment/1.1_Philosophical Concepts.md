Chapter 1 · Philosophical Reflections on Securities Investment

Section 1 · Philosophical Concepts

Investment is a way of life. The stock market is a battlefield of ideas. Amid its rises and falls—sharp price swings and rapid shifts between bull and bear cycles—investors develop deep intuitions about society, human nature, returns, and risk. Many therefore turn to metaphysical traditions—philosophy and religion—for psychological release and consolation. As the I Ching (Yijing) puts it: “What is above form is called the Dao; what is below form is called an instrument” (Wilhelm and Baynes 1967, Book II, Part I, ch. 12).

The word philosophy comes from two ancient Greek terms: philein (“to love”) and sophia (“wisdom”). Literally, philosophy is “love of wisdom” (Encyclopaedia Britannica n.d., s.v. “philosophy”).

Philosophy can be understood in both a narrow and a broad sense. In the narrow sense, it names the tradition (beginning in ancient Greece) that uses concepts and argument to investigate core areas such as metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory (including ethics, aesthetics, and philosophy of religion). In the broad sense, it includes anyone’s ongoing reflection and inquiry into fundamental issues. “Ultimate questions” typically lack ready-made answers and are not decisively settled by observation or experiment—for example: Who am I? Where do we come from? Where are we going? What is the first principle of the world? What is the meaning of human life? (Britannica 2025; OpenStax 2022, §1.2; SEP 2007/2024).

Philosophy—this love and pursuit of wisdom—sits between science and religion. Its beauty lies in penetrating appearances and cutting through superficial, conventional notions to reach the deepest core of things. Philosophy sharpens our logical habits, inspires strategic thinking, and helps cultivate a steady, healthy mindset.

Human beings are destined to think; we are thinking creatures. And the most profound truths are often the simplest and most intuitive.
