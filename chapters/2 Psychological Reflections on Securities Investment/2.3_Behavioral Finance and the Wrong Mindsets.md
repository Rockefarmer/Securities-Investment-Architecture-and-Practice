2.3.1 Cognitive Irrationality: Biases in How We Think

2.3.1.1 Availability Heuristic Bias

People focus on information that is vivid, recent, and easy to recall. The more “visible” something is, the more important we think it is; the more recent the evidence, the more weight it carries. In decisions, we overuse information that comes quickly to mind (things we’ve just seen in the news, or examples we can easily imagine) and ignore slower, harder-to-access data. 

2.3.1.2 Representativeness Bias (Selective Bias)

Humans focus too much on specific features of an event and make impulsive judgments, ignoring the overall probability or sample size. This is often called the "Gambler's Fallacy"—misusing the Law of Large Numbers for small samples. For example, For example, after five consecutive coin tosses land on heads, people guess the next will be tails. In reality, the probability remains 50/50, as each toss is independent.

In investing, this bias manifests as past experience unduly influencing future decisions. A stock that performed well in recent years is assumed to continue doing so; a past growth company is assumed to keep growing. This ignores market fundamentals and accumulated risks, operating on the belief that what went up will keep going up.

2.3.1.3 Overconfidence Bias

Overconfidence is the belief that one's abilities exceed their actual level. Whether it involves IQ, EQ, or social skills, we tend to be overconfident, rating ourselves higher than reality—an innate human trait. Many people believe their driving skills, interpersonal abilities, and sense of humor are above average, which is statistically impossible. Empirical studies show that most drivers rate themselves as safer and more skillful than the average driver. 

Overconfidence often distorts quantitative judgments (e.g., optimistic market index predictions) and future forecasts (e.g., overestimating work speed/efficiency, leading to rushed decisions). The A-share market is filled with participants lacking investment skill who believe they are on par with Warren Buffett. The clearest symptom is frequent trading—constantly trying to validate judgments through transactions, even when often wrong, leading to increased market volume.

2.3.1.4 Wishful Thinking as Objective Prediction

"What you want to happen is what you predict will happen." This is often called "butt-determined brain" (position determines mindset), a low-brow concept that many now accept as a default way of thinking. The desires color the predictions. For example, a high school student who received an anonymous love note. She spent the entire class observing boys, convinced that the one looking "unnatural" wrote it. She eventually decided told her deskmate that it was a specific boy. When asked how she knew, she replied, "Because he's handsome."
2.3.1.5 Self-Attribution Bias

Investors like to believe their own decisions are rational and everyone else’s are irrational. Successes are attributed to personal skill, their own brilliance, while their failures are are blamed on external factors (bad luck, the market, policy, etc.). This prevents honest feedback and learning.

2.3.1.6 Hindsight Bias

The illusion, after an outcome is known, that one "knew it all along", even though they were not sure before. This is a phenomenon of selectively reinforced memory—being a "Monday-morning quarterback." For example, if the market goes up, a person might say, "I knew it would rise," even though they didn't buy any stock because they were actually unsure at the time.

2.3.1.7 Cognitive Dissonance

When reality conflicts with our expectations, it creates psychological discomfort ("This shouldn't be!"). To avoid this pain, people may ignore or distort facts. This bias is subtle and hard for us to notice in ourselves, which makes it even more dangerous.

2.3.1.8 Confirmation Bias

Once people form a view, they actively search for supporting evidence and ignore contradictory information. In reality, both supporting and opposing information exist, but people selectively accept what aligns with their view. The saying "History is a little girl to be dressed up" reflects this bias. In investing, once we like a stock, we pay attention only to bullish news to subjectively confirm the choice and ignore potential risks. Sometimes investors decide to buy first, then do “research” only to prove that the initial choice was correct.

2.3.1.9 Conservatism (Underreaction to New Information)
When making decisions, people often overlook the most direct features of an event and over-focus on information they already possess. Investors also react slowly to new information. For example, if investors expect a new iPhone to boost Apple's stock, but Apple announces a delay, investors often react too slowly to this bad news and fail to adjust their positions in time.

2.3.1.10 Stubbornness / Clinging to Beliefs
We tend to hold on to existing beliefs for too long or too strongly, even when evidence piles up against them, it is hard to change a mindset. Professor Thaler notes that if you were trained early on to believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), it can be hard to change your mind even when there is systematic evidence that contradicts it.

2.3.1.11 Ambiguity Aversion
Faced with uncertain outcomes, investors prefer risks they think they understand over risks they feel are unfamiliar. But because our self-assessment is itself imperfect, this preference may not be rational. We might avoid an unfamiliar but attractive opportunity simply because it feels “uncertain,” while overestimating how well we understand familiar risks. In other words, the human brain is imperfect, and self-assessment is exceptionally difficult, we often pick the wrong risks.


2.3.2 Decision-Making Irrationality
2.3.2.1 Anchoring Effect
A key part of Prospect Theory, this is the tendency to rely heavily on an initial piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions. Anchors can be historical levels, expectations, or peers' decisions, and they can be manipulated.
In investing, people anchor on mental price points for stocks: For losing positions, the purchase price is the anchor: “I won’t sell until it gets back to my cost.” For winning positions, current profit is the anchor: investors over-focus on downside risk and ignore further upside.
Anchoring also occurs by adopting others' opinions (e.g., from financial websites), unconsciously fixing own mind on those numbers, losing independent judgment. Another form: clinging to initial information even when new data arrives. Many make a correct decision based on past information but fail to update their logic, leading to errors. For instance, during annual report season (Feb-Apr), with hundreds of earnings announcements daily, filtering information to identify next-stage investment targets is crucial.
Analysts are also susceptible. Seeing a consensus forecast (e.g., 30% net profit growth) can anchor their own estimates toward that number.

2.3.2.2 Loss Aversion
Deeply rooted in human nature and among the hardest biases to overcome, loss aversion causes significant investor harm. In decision-making, the pain of losing money is about twice as intense as the joy of gaining the same amount. The pain of losing $10 is roughly twice the joy of gaining $10. Facing gains, investors become risk-averse (take profits); facing losses, they become risk-seeking (hold on, hoping for a rebound), refusing to realize the loss and “hoping to get back to even.”. In short, “cut winners, hold losers is a primary reason for consistent retail investor losses.

2.3.2.3 Hyperbolic Discounting
Behavioral economics finds people prefer immediate pleasure and defer pain. This impatience affects investors: For losing trades, the pain of watching the loss makes people want to “get it over with” at the worst moment, sometimes selling right at the bottom just to stop the emotional suffering. Conversely, For desired positions, investors are so eager to own the stock that they ignore signs it is being hyped and chase at peaks instead of waiting for a better entry.

2.3.2.4 Misjudging Probabilities
In decisions, people often incorrectly use "similarity" or "representativeness" instead of proper probabilistic thinking. This manifests as: overestimating low-probability events and underestimating high-probability ones; sometimes people simply treat low probability as 0 and high probability as 100%, leading to irrationality (for example, treating a rare crash as impossible or a likely win as guaranteed).

2.3.2.5 Narrow Framing
Humans don't always consider the big picture (a broad, long-term, portfolio perspective), constrained by temporal and spatial limitations—like viewing scenery through a camera's viewfinder. Instead, they zoom in on a narrow frame
In investing, narrow framing appears spatially as overdiversification or overemphasis on single asset movements, and temporally as frequently checking portfolios, overfocusing on point-in-time ups and downs of individual holdings. The correct perspective cares only about the starting and ending points.
How information is presented affects judgment. For example, "smoking while praying" vs. "praying while smoking" are logically the same but feel different. When reading announcements, news, or reports, beware of being misled. Also, offering choices as affirmations or negations yields different results (e.g., asking "Sprite or Coke?" vs. "What would you like to drink?").

2.3.2.6 Mental Accounting
People create separate mental accounts for different funds, calculating gains/losses in isolation. Investors exhibit different risk preferences based on fund sources. “Easy money” (casino winnings, speculative gains) is often spent quickly. In investing, people may take more risk with profits than with salary income. The rational approach is to view all wealth as one pool and allocate based on total risk and return, not on arbitrary labels like “house money” or “bonus money.”

2.3.2.7 Keynesian Beauty Contest
In a beauty-contest style game, the winning choice is not who you think is most attractive, but who you think everyone else will pick. The stock market is such a game. Prices are set more by what investors expect others to expect than by past facts.
Therefore, Investment decisions should consider others' perspectives, as prices are driven by expectations, not past information.


2.3.3 Trading-Behavior Irrationality
2.3.3.1 Insufficient Diversification
Insufficient Diversification include Home Bias: Investors over-weight local or familiar assets, undermining diversification. Naïve Diversification (1/N Rule): Simply splitting money equally across options rather than calculating true risk correlation. Real diversification aims to combine assets with low correlation, not just “more names.” 

2.3.3.2 Overtrading
Overtrading means trading much more frequently than is rational, based on a mistaken belief that one has enough information (which is usually just noise) or skill to justify constant action. Empirical work shows that individual investors who trade more tend to earn significantly lower returns after costs—“trading is hazardous to your wealth.” Buffett always reminds us of the importance of patience; when good opportunities arise, patient investors are rewarded. Most investors, however, lack patience and act on every seeming opportunity.

2.3.3.3 The tendency to “Selling Winners, Holding Losers.”
The disposition effect is the tendency to: (i) Sell assets that have gone up (realizing gains quickly) and (ii) Hold on to assets that have gone down (refusing to realize losses). This pattern has been documented for individual stocks and mutual fund flows (good funds experience heavy redemptions). It aligns with prospect theory: risk-averse in gains, risk-seeking in losses. 

2.3.3.4 Buy-Side Biases
(i) Momentum chasing (chasing rallies). Investors buy stocks simply because prices have been rising, with little regard for valuation.
(ii) Limited attention. Investors focus on “attention-grabbing” stocks—those with news coverage, unusual trading volume, or extreme recent returns—regardless of whether the underlying news is good or bad.
(iii) Other buy-side biases. Investors may repeatedly trade the same familiar stock, or average down to “reduce the cost basis” even when the firm’s fundamentals are clearly deteriorating.

2.3.3.5 Herding (Herd Behavior)
Social psychology suggests that human irrationality is not random but systematic. Herding occurs when investors abandon their own judgment and simply follow the crowd. In extreme conditions—such as market crashes—panic selling can trigger a stampede that drives prices far away from fundamentals. When individual irrationality becomes synchronized, the “collective IQ” of the group can fall below that of a single rational investor.
Herding is not limited to retail investors. Mutual funds and other institutions also crowd into, and then rush out of, the same stocks. Sector rotation driven mainly by sentiment, and speculative surges in “concept stocks,” are classic manifestations of herd behavior. In such episodes, a “lead sheep” accumulates shares quietly and pushes prices higher; the herd then follows and further inflates the price. Eventually, the leader exits and realizes profits, leaving latecomers holding the bag.

2.3.4 Regularities in the Stock Market
2.3.4.1 Equity Premium Puzzle
Mehra and Prescott (1985) documented that over more than a century in the U.S., stocks earned an average real return around 7.9%, while risk-free assets earned about 1%, leaving an equity premium near 6.9%. Similar patterns hold in other developed markets. This “equity premium puzzle” means that stocks appear to offer a much higher return than standard rational models can explain, suggesting behavioral forces may help justify why investors demand (or receive) such high premia. 

2.3.4.2 Price-Volume Relationship Theory (Miller's Hypothesis)
Miller’s (1977) hypothesis is a classic theory of the price–volume relationship. It states that, in equilibrium, stock prices tend to be overvalued and primarily reflect the expectations of optimistic investors. This result relies on two conditions:
(1) Divergence of opinion among investors.
(2) Short-sale constraints, which limit the ability of pessimists to express their views.
From these conditions follow two key implications:
(i) The greater the divergence of opinion, the more severe the overvaluation.
(ii) The tighter the short-sale constraints, the more severe the overvaluation.
In such markets, pessimists simply stay out, while optimists keep buying, so prices embed the views of optimists rather than the average view. Investor sentiment drives disagreement; disagreement drives trading volume; and trading volume is positively related to price. When short-selling is difficult, high volume often signals a large speculative premium or bubble.
News and media coverage strongly influence investor sentiment and, therefore, the degree of disagreement. In practice, this leads to three conclusions: (i) Stock prices do not reflect average expectations but optimists’ expectations—so price bubbles are a natural outcome. (ii)Greater divergence of opinion is associated with higher trading volume, more severe overvaluation, and larger bubbles. (iii) In markets with tight short-sale constraints, surging volume is a warning sign of especially severe price bubbles.

2.3.4.3 Greater Fool Theory of Price-Volume
The greater-fool theory is more aggressive than Miller’s hypothesis. It argues that prices can move far beyond any rational or fundamental value because buyers believe they can always sell later to a “greater fool” at an even higher price. When everyone expects someone else to buy at a higher price, the equilibrium price can exceed even the most optimistic valuation.
Two key features characterize greater-fool dynamics:
(i) Fast trading. Participants may privately admit that prices are too high, but they still believe there is time to sell to someone else. This belief fuels rapid turnover and rising prices. Investors buy at elevated levels, expecting to resell quickly to a greater fool. It becomes a game of musical chairs or a “hot-potato” game: as long as you are not the last holder when the music stops, you can profit. Overconfidence leads almost everyone to believe they will not be the final fool.
(ii) High volume. Because investors adopt dynamic, short-term strategies, trading volume surges. High short-term volume raises the value of the “resale option” to a greater fool and therefore worsens the bubble. Strong liquidity is a precondition: the more liquid the market or security, the more likely prices are to become severely overvalued. Where liquidity is constrained (for example, due to circuit breakers or thin trading), the resale option is weaker and bubbles are typically smaller.
This mechanism strongly encourages short-term speculation at the expense of long-term investment. Few investors are willing to hold for the long run; instead, they enter the market hoping to extract wealth from others through informational or trading advantages. Once the “hot potato” ends up in your hands and the chain of resale breaks, the risk is enormous.
As Yang Chizhong puts it, “The collective result of speculation exceeds the maddest person’s madness; the system’s combined force adds +1 to the most speculative level.” And, “Because absurdity and ten-fold absurdity are equivalent, a stock only needs partial agreement, not full consensus, to keep rising.” In other words, you do not need everyone to believe in the story—only enough participants to keep the greater-fool game going.
Greater-fool trading is close to the market’s “default mode,” especially in markets dominated by retail investors, such as China, where such speculative and herd-driven behavior is particularly visible.


2.3.5 A Framework for Asset Bubbles
The framework for investment bubbles traces back to John Stuart Mill (1876): "Commercial crises are really not a matter of the purse but of the mind." His model, used by Minsky and Kindleberger, divides bubble formation/bursting into five stages:
(i) New Narrative / Displacement: Birth of prosperity
A new story or shock—new technology, deregulation, or a macro shift—creates fresh profit opportunities and kills old ones. Investment and production surge in the new “hot” area. Mill: "New confidence is generated early, but grows slowly."
(ii) Credit Creation: Bubble Growth
Like fire needs oxygen, prosperity needs credit feeding. Minsky argued monetary/credit expansion is largely endogenous—not just banks, but new credit instruments and non-bank lending create money. Mill noted, "Interest rates are almost always low, credit expands robustly, businesses multiply, profits grow." Credit becomes the fuel for further price increases.
(iii) Euphoria / “This Time Is Different”
Everyone talks about the “new era,” buys the hotspot, believes prices can only rise, discards traditional valuation, adopts new metrics to justify current prices. A wave of over-optimism and overconfidence sweeps the market—"This time is different"—leading to overestimated returns, underestimated risks, and a belief in control. Mill: "Speculation grows fastest when most precarious." In reality, this is when the system is most fragile.
(iv) Critical Point / Financial Distress
Characterized by insiders cashing out. Leverage built up during the boom turns from a tailwind into a serious burden. Financial distress appears—firms or investors struggle to roll over debt, and frauds or weak structures are exposed. The high leverage built during prosperity becomes a severe problem.
(v) Panic and Exit
Once confidence cracks, investors rush for the exits. Forced selling and margin calls cause prices to collapse. As Mill observed, it is not panic that destroys capital—panic merely reveals how much capital was already destroyed during the manic phase. Mill: "Panic does not destroy capital; it merely reveals the extent of destruction wrought by previous madness."
(vi) Long, Slow Recovery
After the crash, the economy endures a period of sluggish growth. Mill found post-bubble recovery "Depression, business failures, and investment write-downs reduce purchasing power... profits remain low due to depressed demand... only time can rebuild shattered confidence and heal deep wounds." Profits stay low, risk appetite is weak, and it takes time for courage and trust to heal. 

Unfortunately, due to innate human cognitive flaws, bubbles repeat in the same manner time and again, bringing us back to the hall of behavioral finance.
