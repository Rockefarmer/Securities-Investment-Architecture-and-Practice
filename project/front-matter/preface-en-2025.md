Preface to the English & Open-Source Edition (2025)

This edition brings Building Securities Investment Systems: Architecture and Practice to a wider audience and to a new medium. It is for practitioners, researchers, and students who want to design investable workflows rather than treat models as black boxes.

A brief history. I began sketching this project nearly twenty years ago -- refining my investment framework and recording my learning path from early curiosity about markets to hands-on roles in research and portfolio work. By 2020 I had assembled a first edition for personal use. As the framework matured and my views deepened, I produced a major revision in 2022, still a private consolidation shared only with a few close friends.

I am now serializing the work on GitHub for three reasons:
- to reach a broader community of like-minded practitioners—and, through collaboration and state-of-the-art machine-learning models, continue upgrading my investment system. 
- because translating and rewriting force me to re-digest ideas, deepening understanding and sharpening the framework; and
- to integrate the project with my Lakehead University research and invite peer review and contributions, leveraging the platform’s collective strength to reveal gaps and improve the system.

What’s different. Unlike earlier versions, this is an open, reproducible project: a serialized repository on GitHub with working code and lightweight datasets. The focus is on what matters now—making ideas executable and auditable. Readers can clone the repo, run notebooks, and submit issues or pull requests to improve both content and code.

How to use this edition. The repository is organized into /book (chapters-in-progress), /code (notebooks and scripts), and /figures. Content is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0; code is MIT. Please report issues, request clarifications, or contribute improvements via GitHub. If you adapt the material, kindly cite this work.

Disclaimer. This project is for educational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice or a solicitation. Markets involve risk; examples are simplified for exposition.

I am grateful to teachers, colleagues, and readers who shared critiques and encouragement. Any remaining errors are mine—and I welcome your corrections.
