Section 2 Western Philosophy and Securities Investment

Ancient Greece is often called the cradle of European civilization and the home of Western philosophy. Broadly, Western philosophy runs through four periods: ancient Greek, medieval, early modern, and modern (Curd, 2022).

Ancient Greek thought grew out of myth and turned to first-principles questions about the cosmos (the archê), with schools like the Milesians, Pythagoreans, and Heracliteans. By the 4th century BCE it became more systematic with Plato and Aristotle. 

In the medieval era, under Latin Christendom, philosophy largely served to explain faith using reason, asking how God and humans, heaven and the earthly world, relate (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).

Early modern philosophy can be sketched in three steps.
- Renaissance (15th–16th c.): it pushed scientific learning, championed individual development, and resisted heavy religious controls (Encyclopaedia Britannica).
- 17th–18th c.: the natural sciences broke free from theology—think Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton—while philosophers probed the relation between subject and object and the unity of thought and being. Bacon exemplified empiricism; Descartes, rationalism (Encyclopaedia Britannica).
- German “classical” philosophy: from Kant to Hegel, it tackled big themes in knowledge, reality, law, and politics and dominated Europe’s philosophical stage around the Industrial Revolution (Encyclopaedia Britannica).

Modern philosophy spans many schools, but a useful rough grouping is scientism and humanism. Scientism approaches philosophical problems with scientific methods and spirit—e.g., positivism, analytic philosophy, and philosophy of science (Encyclopaedia Britannica). Humanism keeps the focus on the human condition—e.g., voluntarism (the will), Lebensphilosophie (philosophy of life), phenomenology, existentialism, and hermeneutics (Encyclopaedia Britannica).

In my own investing over more than two decades, two frameworks have mattered most: Husserl’s phenomenology and Popper’s critical rationalism. Phenomenology reminds me to slow down, bracket bullish/bearish biases and unhelpful emotion, and look at market facts carefully—from different angles and levels—so I can base decisions on truer signals (Beyer, 2015; Smith, 2013). Popper’s view adds the logic of falsification: beyond consensus stories about the market or a stock, look for the gaps or blind spots in the thesis—and act when you find them (Hansson, 2017; Thornton, 2012).
