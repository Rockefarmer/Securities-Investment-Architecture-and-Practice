1.2.2. Popper and His Philosophy

1. Popper and the Falsification Principle

Sir Karl Popper (July 28, 1902 – September 17, 1994), born in Austria, was one of the most famous academic theorists and philosophers of the 20th century (Popper, 1994).

His philosophy, critical rationalism, centers on the idea that all theories and principles can be falsified. Popper believed that scientific theories and all human knowledge are merely conjectures and hypotheses. When solving problems, humans inevitably use imagination and creativity, and problems can only be addressed within specific historical and cultural frameworks. We can only build scientific theories based on the limited data available; there can never be enough experimental data to prove a scientific theory absolutely correct. The principle of “fallibility” leads to an “asymmetry of truth and falsity”: truth cannot be conclusively proven, but falsehood can be decisively shown. (Popper, 1963).

Science lies in the fact that it can be falsified and does not bow to any authority. True rationality means being open to criticism, avoiding superstition and blind obedience. Popper's rational attitude was: "I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth" (Popper, 1945, p. 225).

Falsificationism tells us that all science is just guesswork and hypothesis; it can never be proven conclusively but can be falsified at any time. Even observing thousands of white swans isn't enough to prove that "all swans are white," but finding one black swan immediately falsifies that statement. Therefore, we must adhere to the principle of falsification, using empirical observation as a touchstone for testing theories and avoiding the defense of wrong theories and dogma.

2. Falsificationism Requires a "Negative" Thought Process

Currently, securities investment primarily uses two analytical methods: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.
Fundamental analysis uses the law of value – that price fluctuates around intrinsic value. Based on accurately judging a security's value, decisions are made depending on whether the market price is above or below this value reference point. Judging a security's value is an activity leaning towards affirmation, so investors using fundamental analysis often develop an affirmative thought process. However, to become a successful professional investor, one's thought process must transition from affirmation to negation, maintaining an open mindset. A typical example is Warren Buffett. He compares investing to a baseball batter's swing. A famous American batter once divided the strike zone into 77 small squares, each only the size of a baseball. If the ball lands in the "best" squares, swinging yields good results; if it lands in the "worst" squares, even the best batter will only achieve average results. Buffett said, "If every investor had only 20 decision-making opportunities in their lifetime, it would force you to seek the best investment decisions" (Loomis, 2001). In this process, the thought process is negative – rejecting countless wrong answers – leaving the best investment decisions.

The core of technical analysis is "buying rising stocks and selling falling ones," the key to which is trend. It requires constantly "doubting" the validity of the trend, and the process of judging whether a trend is effective naturally forms a "negative" thought process. George Soros is a student of Popper and a devoted follower. When forming an investment thesis, Soros calls it a "temporary hypothesis." He believes his interpretation of the situation is inevitably flawed, so he actively seeks out defects in every investment idea, tries to find where his view differs from the prevailing one, and constantly looks for mistakes in himself or the market. Once a mistake is found, he capitalizes on it, profiting from his own or the market's errors (Soros, 1987). His "Theory of Reflexivity" is a framework suited to non-equilibrium states, but the key to Soros's success is admitting mistakes – not just others', but his own. Only by admitting one's own mistakes can one correctly avoid them when they occur. For example, in March 2000, Soros was bearish on the internet stock frenzy but suffered significant losses during the crash. Consequently, he ceased operations of the Quantum Fund (Soros, 2000). Closing the fund was the best way to stop his mistake.

3. Beneficial Insights from Falsificationism for Securities Investment
Falsificationism teaches us there are no absolute, eternal truths. Similarly, in securities investment, no principle or experience is always correct. Whether fundamental or technical analysis, they can be right or wrong at different times.

As professional investors, we recognize many flaws exist in our own belief systems, thought processes, psychological perceptions, and trading operations. Even expending a lifetime of effort won't eliminate all these flaws or errors. Conversely, if we accept this willingly as normal, we quietly realize "imperfection is beauty." Admitting flaws and mistakes, and striving to learn from them, is a key step toward investment success.

Falsificationism should employ the method of trial and error: boldly proposing hypotheses and conjectures, then testing and modifying them through observation, even completely rejecting the initial hypothesis. Falsificationist thinking in securities investment includes:

(1) Regarding the current securities market, boldly propose bullish or bearish hypotheses, then actively look for evidence that contradicts these hypotheses. Modify the hypotheses based on this evidence and repeat the process continuously.

(2) For popular market concepts, themes, and hotspots – like the recent trends in blockchain, the Apple industrial chain, and tech innovation – maintain vigilant skepticism while actively participating in trial and error. Seek market opportunities and stocks with favorable probability and odds. Seize these market opportunities to gain investment returns before they are "falsified."

(3) Admit that you might be wrong. Constantly remind yourself and make corrections. Once an idea is "falsified," or you discover or confirm your mistake, immediately admit the error, "cut losses," and exit the wrong trade.

(4) Any popular market theory or bullish/bearish view has its applicable boundaries or blind spots. Once the market approaches these boundaries or blind spots, it might signal the arrival of a contrarian investment opportunity.

Popper said, "What cannot be falsified is pseudoscience" (Popper, 1963). But a deeply ingrained human desire is the pursuit of perfection and refusal to admit mistakes. Any theory has insurmountable flaws. The theoretical foundation of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) included the "Martingale strategy," whose subtext was: "We cannot be wrong!" The method derived from this was, when initial judgments caused losses, to double down to prove oneself even more correct. This is an ideal trading theory, premised on having unlimited funds and an infinitely large market to absorb those funds. But in reality, our capital is always limited; we cannot double down indefinitely. There always comes a point where you can no longer use capital to prove yourself right. Once this happens, all previous mistakes accumulate into one massive, fatal error.

In securities investment, we often see typical errors like averaging down at lower prices to reduce cost basis. This is essentially a refusal to admit mistakes. Letting go at the cliff's edge is easy; turning back before the critical point is hard... Why? Because when we are in a dilemma, impulsive lack of restraint easily pushes us to make mistakes – we close our eyes and jump. But if truly faced with a dilemma where a choice must be made, few can actually pull back. Admitting one's mistakes requires constant self-reminders, continuous correction, and immediate self-protection when problems arise.
