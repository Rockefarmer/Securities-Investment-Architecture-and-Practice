I. The Investment Wisdom of Laozi's Daodejing
The Daodejing (6th–5th c. BCE), a renowned philosophical work by Laozi from the Spring and Autumn period, discusses the Way (Dao) of self-cultivation, governing the state, employing military force, and nurturing life (Lau, 1963). As professional investors, we are fundamentally pursuing profit, yet capital “flows like water.” Laozi's saying, "The highest goodness is like water," invites us to act softly, benefit others, and step back after success—“ achieve success, accomplish our aim, and then withdraw—this is the natural Way (Tian Dao)” (Laozi, DDJ 8; Lau, 1963/1989).

1. The Philosophy of Being and Non-being Generating Each Other
The Daodejing begins by discussing the Dao, expounding the philosophical idea that being (you) comes from non-being (wu), and vice versa. The moon waxes and wanes; the year has spring, summer, autumn, and winter. All things follow cycles of recurrence, and the world of investment is no different. Bulls and bears alternate, as one wanes, the other waxes. In my nearly 20-year investment career, I have always had a preference for bear markets. During the most difficult times, I often silently recite the famous saying: "In times of difficulty, we must see our achievements, see the brightness, and increase our courage. Favorable situations and the recovery of initiative arise from the effort to 'persist just a little longer'." Then, I hold fast to the "Way" of value investing: buying high-quality growth stocks at bargain-basement prices and going full position, holding on with immense determination and patience. Without exception, as long as I endured the bear market, the sunny days of the bull market arrived. The reverse is also true. When the bull market is extremely euphoric and狂热, one must not become carried away but remain vigilant, guarding against the possibility of the market turning bearish. Laozi said, "Disaster is what good fortune depends upon; good fortune is what disaster lies hidden within" (Lau, 1963). Misfortune and blessing hinge upon each other; bear and bull markets follow one another—a universal truth.
Being and non-being can also represent the shifts between being fully invested and holding cash. "Constantly without desire, one observes its mysteries" (Lau, 1963). In a bear market, maintain a cash or light position, contemplating the investment principle of buying high-quality growth stocks at very low prices. "Constantly having desire, one observes its manifestations" (Lau, 1963). In a bull market, maintain a high or full position—"holding stocks in hand, but no stocks in heart"—while carefully observing the boundaries of the bull market and maintaining inner vigilance. This is a very high realm of investing, requiring long-term cultivation and practice. Furthermore, being and non-being can represent open-mindedness versus self-satisfaction. Regularly empty yourself of preconceptions, biases, and forecasts, timely "returning to zero," going back to the beginner's mind, arriving at "non-being." Treat each waking day as a rebirth, facing the future positively.

2. Reverence, Gratitude, Knowing When Enough is Enough, and Withdrawing after Success
The stock market is an arena of fame and fortune, where human greed and fear are rapidly amplified and laid bare. "Heaven is eternal and earth everlasting. They can be eternal and everlasting because they do not live for themselves. Therefore, the sage places himself last and finds himself first, relegates his person and thereby preserves his person. Is it not because he is without self-interest that his self-interest is achieved?" (Lau, 1963). Therefore, we must overcome these human weaknesses, maintain awe for the market, remember gratitude and humility when we profit, and place ourselves outside the pursuit of fame and money. By doing so, we can preserve ourselves and gain precious survival opportunities. Whether in entrepreneurship or investment, seeking money and fame is not inherently wrong, but if pursued solely for those ends, one may not achieve great scale or go the distance. Thus, it's crucial to learn awe and gratitude.
"There is no disaster greater than not knowing what is enough. There is no fault greater than wishing to acquire. Therefore, the sufficiency of knowing what is enough is eternal sufficiency" (Lau, 1963). We must firmly remember: "Do not push an advantage to its limit; do not enjoy blessings to the full." The greatest scourge in investing is insatiable greed—demanding daily limit-ups and yearly doubling of one's capital. In June 2013, I left Everbright Securities Asset Management with an annual expected return rate of 10%. Consequently, in selecting investments, I leaned more towards low-risk opportunities, which I called "bending over to pick up money" opportunities. I successively participated in the tender offer for Chongqing Brewery, arbitrage on the mergers of Shenwan Hongyuan and CNR/CSR, performance compensation arbitrage with Dalian Heavy Industry, and the share conversion arbitrage of B-shares like Dongdian, Yangchen, Livzon, and Future Land. Looking back, the annual performance returns far exceeded 10%, and I am filled with gratitude and awe for achieving even higher returns. I recall what the Head of HR, Yu Zong, told me when I worked in the securities building: "Wealth does not enter the door of the impatient." How true that is.

3. The Weakness Mindset: The Soft and Weak Overcomes the Hard and Strong
Laozi said: "When a man is born, he is soft and weak; when he dies, he is stiff and hard. When the ten thousand things and grasses and trees are alive, they are soft and pliant; when they are dead, they are withered and dry. Therefore, the stiff and hard are disciples of death; the soft and weak are disciples of life. Thus, an army that is inflexible will not conquer; a tree that is inflexible will break. The great and strong occupy the lower position; the soft and weak occupy the higher position" (Lau, 1963). Holding fast to softness and weakness is the practical application of the Dao's principles. People, animals, and plants are soft and pliable when alive, becoming stiff and rigid after death. In the securities market, one should place oneself in the position of the weak, using the softest, most natural methods, allowing excellent companies to be the natural choice. Even for stocks one is very confident in, one should reserve a significant margin of safety as a buffer for error and risk. Everything should comply with the natural order, everything should be soft and weak, non-contentious.

4. Uphold the Normal, Employ the Extraordinary; Govern by Non-Action; Avoid Unnecessary Meddling
"Govern the state by the normal (zheng), employ the military by the extraordinary (qi), but win the empire by non-interference" (Lau, 1963). In investing, one must adhere to the basic principles of value and growth—this is "upholding the normal." To achieve excess returns, one must "employ the extraordinary" to win in areas of high confidence and probability. In the second half of 2019, after years of a bear market, opportunities were quietly emerging in the New Third Board (NEEQ), presenting an excellent chance for policy arbitrage. As policies were gradually realized by year-end, the valuations of quality companies rapidly corrected within an extremely short period, easily yielding 2 to 5 times the investment return.
"In the pursuit of learning, one increases day by day; in the pursuit of the Way (Dao), one decreases day by day. One decreases and further decreases until one arrives at non-action (wuwei)" (Lau, 1963). The great Dao is supremely simple. Only by continually comprehending these simplest principles can one reach the realm of the Dao. Having tasted all flavors of life and seen its繁华, one finds blandness the most beautiful and plainness the most genuine. But "non-action does not mean shirking or not acting; it merely means acting without forced intention or expectation, following nature completely..." (Lau, 1963). What seems like non-action is actually all-encompassing action. It is the same in investing: cast a long line to catch a big fish; hold stocks with tranquility and patience.

5. Follow the Great Way in Investing; Stay Within Your Circle of Competence
"The greatest straightness seems crooked; the greatest skill seems clumsy; the greatest eloquence seems stammering. Quiescence overcomes agitation; cold overcomes heat. By limpid quietness, one can put the world in order" (Lau, 1963). The great "Way" of investing is level and straightforward: research good companies, wait for a good price, and hold patiently. This seems quiet and non-active, but in reality, it allows one to calmly control the overall situation, not only enjoying high returns but also a very high quality of life. However, the market offers too many temptations: following the crowd, listening to tips, speculating on concepts, seeking shortcuts, staring at quotes all day, frequent trading—expending immense passion and energy, only to lose significant money in the end.
"To know yet to think that one does not know is best; not to know yet to think that one knows is a disease" (Lau, 1963). Knowing that there are things you do not know is truly excellent. Not knowing but thinking you know is a flaw. In investing, we must stay firmly within our circle of competence. Never touch industries or companies you do not understand. The size of our ability is not as important as ensuring we operate within its boundaries.

6. The Dao Gives Birth To It; Virtue Fosters It; Matter Gives It Form; Circumstance Completes It
"The Dao gives birth to it" is the root of an excellent enterprise. A company that has grasped the "Dao," no matter how small and humble its beginnings, will ultimately grow into a towering tree. Every truly excellent enterprise must necessarily be "born of the Dao."
"Virtue (De) fosters it" is also crucial. After being "born of the Dao," if a company lacks the correct values and business ethics, no matter how large it becomes, it ultimately cannot be "fostered." This is especially true after a company goes public; the pressure from quarterly and annual reports is immense, making it more likely to cross ethical lines in management and operations.
"Matter gives it form," from the perspective of stock selection and investment, has two meanings: First, it refers to the operational factors of the enterprise, such as its business model, industry characteristics, etc., which shape the specific state of its business. Second, it refers to the soft factors like the corporate governance mechanism and management culture, which also significantly impact the enterprise's growth trajectory.
"Circumstance (Shi) completes it" is easily understood. Mencius also said, "Though one may have wisdom, it is better to ride the circumstance (Shi)." This refers to the situation and opportunities an enterprise faces. If a company has grasped the "Dao," possesses "De," and also has a good "form," then when the "circumstance" (Shi) arrives, it may become an excellent investment target. As the saying goes, "Man proposes, heaven disposes."
