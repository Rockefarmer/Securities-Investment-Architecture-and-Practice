1.2.1	Phenomenology and the Observational Framework for Securities Investment

1. Husserl and the Birth of Phenomenology

Edmund Husserl (1859–1938) was an Austrian-born German philosopher best known as the founder of phenomenology and also regarded as one of the greatest modern philosophers. (Encyclopaedia Britannica, n.d.-a).

The fundamental principle of phenomenology is "to the things themselves," advocating that people free themselves from traditional concepts, ideas, prejudices, and habitual ways of thinking, liberate themselves from all theoretical preconceptions, understand matters from the initially perceived "pure" phenomena, and acquire knowledge through direct perception, observation, and intuition, thereby expanding and deepening the scope of direct experience (Smith, 2013). Phenomenology includes three analytical methods: epoche, eidetic intuition, and transcendental reduction.

(1) Epoche, one of Husserl's most original methodological ideas, is also known as the "bracketing method" or "suspension of judgment." It involves suspending the question of whether the given things exist, "bracketing" the external world to render it ineffective. This means setting aside one's own uncertain and indirect preconceptions, biases, opinions, etc., temporarily refraining from judgment—neither affirming nor denying—and first engaging in direct observation and perception (Beyer, 2015; Encyclopaedia Britannica, n.d.-b).

(2) Eidetic intuition, also referred to as eidetic reduction, is a famous slogan proposed by Husserl: "to the things themselves." It means facing things as they are, contemplating the things themselves rather than substitutes for them, and extracting the essence of things from individual entities. (Encyclopaedia Britannica, n.d.-b).

(3) Transcendental reduction addresses the issues suspended by epoche and deals with metaphysical questions in phenomenology. Husserl believed that when people think about problems, they tend to take certain things for granted, habitually regard certain views as self-evident, and unconsciously use them as the basis for argumentation. In fact, these foundations often require proof, leading to circular reasoning. (Beyer, 2015).

Husserl borrowed the term "suspension of judgment" from ancient Greek skeptics and, following Descartes' path of doubt expressed in "I think, therefore I am," sought to establish a reliable and certain starting point for the system of knowledge (Beyer, 2015; Smith, 2013). Epoche is essentially a process of clearing away old preconceptions, biases, and foresights to generate new knowledge, providing people with an original starting point for understanding things. It is a method to perceive things from a new, open, and impartial perspective, time, and space, ultimately reaching the truth.

Applied to markets, a phenomenological stance means: quiet the mind, bracket bullish/bearish priors and emotional noise, and observe price/volume, news, and behavior directly and from multiple angles before theorizing. Use epoché to discipline attention, eidetic work to find the essential pattern in recurring situations, and the transcendental turn to check how your own standpoint shapes what you “see” (Beyer, 2015; Encyclopaedia Britannica, n.d.-b; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.).

2. A Phenomenological Observation Framework for Capital Markets

2.1 What “framework” means in a phenomenological reading

Applying the philosophical methodology of phenomenology to the securities market, the reliable starting point we seek requires eliminating various subjective and psychological interferences, and constructing an observational framework for the complex and diverse economic and stock market information (Beyer, 2015; Smith, 2013).

In this regard, my former leader, Mr. Yang Chizhong, mentioned the concept of a "framework" in his book From Investment Markets to Government Management. He stated, "The 'frame' represents constraints, while the 'work' represents support. When deconstructing a subject, one must prioritize based on importance, breaking it down into its complete and mutually exclusive elements and laying them out. Only in this way can we avoid the parable of the blind men and the elephant." (Yang, 2018). Mr. Yang's framework for the securities market is a top-down approach characterized by "three horizontals, two verticals, and six factors." 

He further elaborated: "Thinking must be comprehensive, but research and investment must be unified. One should grasp the overall picture from macro fundamentals → macro market conditions → meso/industry fundamentals → meso/industry market → micro/company fundamentals → micro/stock market. The larger the capital size, the more top-down one should be; the stronger the market trend, the more top-down one should be; the more distinct the trading entities, the more top-down one should be."  (Yang, 2018).

- The First Horizontal: Macro Fundamentals and Macro Market Conditions. (1) Macro fundamentals include supply and demand, policies, profits, and valuations. Among these, policies serve as the intermediary through which the superstructure influences the economic base; profit represents the "perilous leap"; and valuation is essentially the wealth creation factor. Often, those who achieve great success in the securities market actually profit from valuations. (2) Macro market conditions include capital, policies, market risk appetite, etc (Yang, 2018).

- The Second Horizontal: Meso Industry Fundamentals and Market Conditions. Porter's Five Forces is a highly useful analytical method for meso industry fundamentals. When observing meso industry market conditions, four aspects should be noted: (1) slope and turning points of the trend; (2) policy catalysts; (3) relative valuation ratio of the industry to the whole market and its historical discount/premium (Yang, 2018).

- The Third Horizontal: 

Micro Fundamentals and Market Conditions. (1) Generally, micro fundamentals focus on moats and profit models, followed by innovation, strategy, and management. (2) Strategy must emphasize practicality and flexibility, while management must emphasize applicability. (3) Third are performance and growth. Good performance must be accompanied by growth; discounted cash flow without growth is termed "dead discounting." (4) Fourth is certainty. Warren Buffett refers to this as "shooting fish in a barrel," but certainty varies individually based on IQ, diligence, and methodology. It is best when the market perceives uncertainty, but you identify certainty. (5) Fifth is the margin of safety. When considering the margin of safety, valuations should be adjusted for cyclical influences.

Micro market conditions include: (1) The popularity of individual stocks — ideally, those that have never been noticed but are now improving. (2) Cumulative high turnover rates. (3) Expectation gaps, including novelty and variability. (4) Catalysts. (5) Trends — as the saying goes, "even a pig can fly if it catches the right trend." appropriate (Yang, 2018)

3. Beneficial Reflections of Phenomenology on Securities Investment

Phenomenology, though abstruse, provides a beneficial philosophical methodology for interpreting capital markets. When analyzing the economy and capital markets, emphasis should be placed on the originality and breadth of analytical materials, rather than filtering and selecting through bullish or bearish biases. Additionally, one must clear away various old preconceptions or prejudices. As steadfast adherents of Husserlian phenomenology, when facing the securities market itself, we need to eliminate or suspend the following (Beyer, 2015; Smith, 2013):

- Negative emotions and psychological fluctuations. Collective mania and panic can even cause the most resolute individuals to lose themselves. Even a person with independent views, once joining a crowd, becomes part of the mob, where groupthink dominates absolutely, IQ is lowered, and individuality is obliterated. (Mackay, 1841/1852; Bikhchandani & Sharma, 2001).

- Bullish or bearish biases. As the saying goes, "where you stand depends on where you sit." Faced with the same stock market decline, bulls may see it as a shakeout, while bears view it as distribution. Due to human cognitive biases, we are often unconsciously led by our positions and pre-existing bullish or bearish judgments, intentionally or unintentionally filtering out and ignoring a great deal of valuable information (Barberis & Thaler, 2003; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). 

- Old knowledge systems and thinking habits, including valuable experiences accumulated over the years. Even “useful experience” can become a blind spot when conditions change (Barberis & Thaler, 2003).

After eliminating or suspending the above three aspects, we can make our information as comprehensive, reliable, and objective as possible, thereby aiding us in forming conclusions and judgments. Years of investment experience have taught me that we must respect the market, follow trends, maintain our rationality and independence, and occasionally step back to observe the market from a distance. We should not be constrained by preseting positions, but rather set aside bullish or bearish prejudices. After careful analysis and conclusion, we should draw conclusions where possible, and where immediate judgment is not feasible, we should suspend judgment and observe closely later. Avoid hasty and rash conclusions. Only in this way can we capture a more authentic market, make more credible judgments, and appreciate the madness and complexity of human nature (Beyer, 2015; Smith, 2013; Bikhchandani & Sharma, 2001).
