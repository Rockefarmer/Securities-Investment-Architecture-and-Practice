Preface to the Second Edition (2022)

Just before the 2021 Spring Festival, I found two Q&A collections by Duan Yongping on the Xueqiu website—one on business logic and one on investment logic. I read them line by line, looking for ideas about corporate culture, business models, product differences, and investment principles. Wisdom shines in every paragraph. Over the holiday I read them five or six times—reading, taking notes, reflecting, acting—then repeating. Each reread felt “thinner” yet richer in insight.

Mr. Duan has truly absorbed the spirit of Buffett and Munger. He stresses integrity and a calm mind: do the right things, then do things right. His secret for long-term success is a “Stop Doing List”—cut the bad habits so the good ones can last. In investing, buying a stock means buying a business—the present value of its future net cash flows. With Kweichow Moutai and Apple as examples, he lays out the three essentials for great companies: Right Business, Right People, Right Price.

I first studied Buffett and Munger in 2003—circle of competence, margin of safety, long-term investing, and more. Yet for over a decade I circled outside the “temple” of investing, searching without a breakthrough. Reading Mr. Duan during the 2021 holiday cleared the fog. He says the most important lessons from Buffett are: Don’t short. Don’t use margin. Don’t buy what you don’t understand. His “Stop Doing List” hit me hard. I felt ashamed—and grateful.

Before that, I had crossed Buffett’s “no-go” lines: at times I wanted to add leverage, short the index, or trade options—breaking the big rules. Mr. Duan says that once you see you’re wrong, fix it immediately—it’s the lowest-cost choice. In 2021 I decided to reset my framework and follow his approach, starting with the Stop Doing List. When markets reopened after the Spring Festival, I closed all those positions—margin/leverage, shorts, and options. After that, I stopped worrying about daily swings. It became the most relaxed, balanced year of my 20+ years of investing.

In 2017, average life expectancy in Shanghai was 83. Live 10% longer and you reach 91; 10% shorter is 75—a 16-year difference. At 8% annual returns, 16 extra years of compounding gives about 3.4× the final value. Buffett’s wealth was about $36B at age 72; by 91 it was about $101B—roughly 3× more. Time matters.

Imitation is the best way to learn. Building on the first edition, I used the 2022 Spring Festival to weave Mr. Duan’s investment system into this second edition. I am still far from the “monkey who knows how to invest” he describes, but I am a monkey willing to work hard, stay open, and practice his ideas. Thank you, Mr. Duan, for your invaluable guidance.
