Preface to the First Edition (2020)

This project began in 2006, when I worked in the President’s Office at Everbright Securities. My leader was deeply skilled in research and investing. Under his influence, I tried to summarize his investment framework like investment vs. speculation, short-term swings vs. long-term potential, risk control, etc.

In January 2008 I moved to Everbright’s Asset Management Department and managed three collective mutual funds. Soon the U.S. subprime crisis set off global turmoil, and China’s A-share bear market had just begun. In that uncertainty I went back to basics——reading classics on investment philosophy, principles, strategy, execution, and psychology. I also learned from top private investors on major finance forums——especially the Minfa Duocai forum at its peak. Voices like “Yixiao Jie Qianchou,” “Luo Jing,” and well-known users such as Maotai03 broadened my view of research, investing, and trading. Later, on the other forums, some friends offered sharp insights on investment philosophy that filled important gaps for me. 

In June 2013 I left Everbright and spent time freelancing and then co-founded HonestFund Asset Management. I’ve driven across Tibet, Inner Mongolia, northeastern provinces, and along the coastlines of both the northeast and the southeast of China, and later through the U.S., Canada, France, and Switzerland —— taking in the grandeur of the land. In the same spirit, I try to appreciate the beauty of market volatility, approach markets with respect and gratitude, and calmly prepare for and manage risk. During the 2015–2016 turmoil, I also lived through the first, second, and third waves of the crash (often called Crash 1.0/2.0/3.0), when thousands of stocks hit limit down—hard times that force reflection. At the end of 2016, I joined KingFortune Investment and again on research and practice. Beyond the trading in stock market, we also pursued venture capital and private-equity investments and launched a fund targeting China’s NEEQ (National Equities Exchange and Quotations) which has since become the Beijing Stock Exchange.

In late 2018 my former leader Mr. Yang gave a talk series, From the Investment Market to Government Management, which inspired me greatly. I quote his investment framework and many of his insights in this book. I still remember his advice at an Everbright training in 2002: “Learn to live without relying on any organization.” That line still guides me, and I’m grateful.

Around the Lunar New Year 2020, I stayed home for an extended period, and began designing a securities-investment system. I finished the first draft on February 1, 2020. After several rounds of edits, I finalized it with a strong sense of accomplishment.
