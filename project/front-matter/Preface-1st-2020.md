Preface to the First Edition (2020)

This project began in 2006, when I worked in the President’s Office at Everbright Securities under my leader. He was deeply skilled in research and investing. Under his influence, I tried to summarize his investment framework like investment vs. speculation, short-term swings vs. long-term potential, and risk control.

In January 2008 I moved to Everbright’s Asset Management Department and managed three collective mutual funds. Soon the U.S. subprime crisis set off global turmoil, and China’s A-share bear market had just begun. In that uncertainty I went back to basics—reading classics on investment philosophy, psychology, principles, strategy, and execution. I also learned from top private investors on major finance forums—especially the Minfa Duocai forum at its peak. Voices like “Yixiao Jie Qianchou,” “Luo Jing,” and well-known users such as Maotai03 broadened my view of research, investing, and trading. Later, on the other forums, some friends offered sharp insights on investment philosophy that filled important gaps for me. 

In June 2013 I left Everbright and spent time freelancing and then joined HonestFund Asset Management. I drove across Tibet, Northeast/Inner Mongolia, the South China coast, and later to the U.S., Canada, France, and Switzerland. During the 2015–2016 turmoil, I also lived through the first, second, and third waves of the crash (often called Crash 1.0/2.0/3.0), when thousands of stocks hit limit down—hard times that force reflection. At the end of 2016, I joined KingFortune Investment and again on research and practice. Beyond the trading in stock market, we also did VC and PE investments and launched a fund for China’s NEEQ (“New Third Board”).

In late 2018 my former leader Mr. Yang gave a talk series, From the Investment Market to Government Management, which inspired me greatly. I quote his investment framework and many of his insights in this book. I still remember his advice at an Everbright training in 2002: “Learn to live without relying on any organization.” That line still guides me, and I’m grateful.

Around the 2020 Lunar New Year, I stayed home and began to plan and build systems for Securities Investment. I finished the first draft on February 1, my younger son’s fourth birthday. After several rounds of edits, I finalized it on February 28, another important day for me.
