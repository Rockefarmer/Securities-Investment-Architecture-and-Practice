2.1 Charlie Munger on the Psychology of Human Misjudgment
Charlie Munger is often described as one of the wisest people in the world, unfortunately, he died on November 28, 2023, at age 99. His book Poor Charlie’s Almanack shares his life wisdom, and he believes that psychology is an essential part of “worldly wisdom.” He even stated directly, "Of all the models people ought to have but don't, perhaps the most important comes from psychology."
The Almanack includes Munger’s famous talk, "The Psychology of Human Misjudgment." He said, “The human perceptual system clearly shows that the brain can indeed malfunction. People are easily fooled—whether by carefully designed deception, accidental environmental factors, or highly effective control techniques mastered through diligent practice.” He also noted, “Even when aware, the human brain often misjudges what it perceives because it only notices sharp contrasts and cannot estimate changes in perception with the precision of scientific instruments.” The speech outlines 25 psychological tendencies that easily lead to bad judgment. Because later in this chapter we will come back to these ideas in behavioral finance, we briefly highlight a few of them here:


1.Reward and punishment “super-response” tendency.
Incentive systems are extremely powerful. They can make people feel justified even when they are doing harmful things. A common consequence of incentive-caused bias is that people tend to exploit loopholes in any system and become remarkable creative at benefiting themselves at others’ expense. Punishment also strongly affects behavior and cognition, although it is usually less flexible and less effective than rewards.
2.Liking/loving and disliking/hating tendency.
Love and hate both can distort facts. When we strongly like or dislike someone or something, we tend to ignore evidence that doesn’t fit our feelings.
3.Inconsistency-avoidance tendency.
New ideas are hard to accept when they clash with old beliefs. Munger compares the human mind to an egg cell: once one sperm gets in, the egg closes itself to block all the others. In a similar way, once a belief enters our mind, we often shut out competing ideas.
4.Simple, pain-avoiding psychological denial.
When reality is too painful to bear, people twist or deny facts until those facts feel bearable. The most extreme outcomes of this tendency often show up around love, death, and addictions to substances like alcohol or drugs.
5.Overconfidence and Overoptimism Tendency.
In 300 BC, Demosthenes, the most famous ancient Greek orator, said, “What a man wishes, he will also believe.” People are often too optimistic and overestimate their own abilities or the chances of good outcomes.
6.Deprival Superreaction Tendency. 
The pleasure gained from receiving $10 is not equal in size to the pain of losing 10 dollars. Loss hurts more than gain pleases us. In other words, the psychological damage from losing is much greater than the joy from winning the same amount.
7.Availability tendency.
This tendency is captured by the song lyric: “If you can't be with the one you love, love the one you're with,” The human mind is limited and imperfect. It easily settles for what is close at hand and then overestimates the importance of whatever is easiest to recall or obtain.
