The Yijing says: “What is above form is called the Dao; what is below form is called instruments.” In other words, principle is formless, tools are formed; tools serve the Way. Mastering the Way of investing takes years of dedicated contemplation, practice and many rounds of trial, absolutely not an achievement for a single day or night (Pregadio, 2004; Wilhelm & Baynes, 1967/1997). Traditional Chinese thought values “cultivating the self, ordering the family, governing the state, bringing peace to the world.” The classical wisdom found in the Zhouyi, Analects, Daodejing, and others can lift our discipline, widen our perspective, and steady our temperament as investors.
