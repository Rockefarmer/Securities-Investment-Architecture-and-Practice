III. The Investment Wisdom of the Zhouyi (I Ching)

The Book of Changes (Zhouyi), revered as the foremost of all Chinese classics, contains simple yet profound natural laws and a philosophy of harmony and dialectics (Lynn, 1994). It portrays the basic features of the cosmos and the attributes of things under Heaven (Wilhelm & Baynes, 1967/1997).

The word "Yi" (易) carries three meanings: "change," "simplicity," and "constancy" (Wilhelm & Baynes, 1967). (i) Change: Symbolized by the sun (日) and moon (月) succeeding each other, it means that the sun and moon take turns; cold and heat alternate—everything is always in flux. (ii) Simplicity: The complex principles of all phenomena can be understood through the interplay of yin and yang—opposed yet complementary—covers the patterns of myriad things. (iii) Constancy: While the world is complex and ever-changing, the underlying patterns—like the operation of heaven and earth, the succession of seasons, the alternation of hot and cold, and the principle that things reverse upon reaching an extreme—are eternal and unchanging. These ideas are gathered in the “Appended Statements/Great Commentary” (Xìcí) (Lynn, 1994, pp. 45–47; Wilhelm & Baynes, 1967/1997, “Xici”). In short: in principle we “answer the myriad changes with what is unchanging,” while in methods we adapt change with change (Lynn, 1994).

The Qian (乾) hexagram, representing Heaven and the Creative, has six lines. Read as an investing analogy, they sketch a full bull-market cycle (line glosses from Wilhelm & Baynes, 1967/1997; Lynn, 1994). 
1.	Initial Nine: Hidden Dragon. Do not use.
The characteristic is being "hidden." This is the fund accumulation phase, where the market trend will not appear too strong, lest the rally may burn out quickly (Wilhelm & Baynes, Hex. 1, line 1).

2.	Nine in the Second: Dragon appearing in the field. It is beneficial to see the great man.
The characteristic is "appearing." This stage is profitable. The market gradually finds the logic for a bull market's start, showing initial bullish characteristics. The early, perceptive investors move quickly—good, workable opportunities emerge (Wilhelm & Baynes, Hex. 1, line 2).

3.	Nine in the Third: The nobleman is creatively active all day, and in the evening still alert and cautious. There is danger, but no blame.
The characteristic is "danger." Only by remaining vigilant throughout this stage can one avoid major mistakes. This line is crucial for whether a major bull market can truly emerge; it's the critical leap from the lower trigram to the upper trigram. A durable bull often needs a solid mid-cycle shakeout before advancing (Wilhelm & Baynes, Hex. 1, line 3).

4.	Nine in the Fourth: Wavering flight over the depths. No blame.
The manifestation is "fear." Actually, the bull market is already underway at this stage, but people have not yet emerged from the shadow of the previous adjustment and still harbor fear. This is when "the market advances amid hesitation." (Wilhelm & Baynes, Hex. 1, line 4)

5.	Nine in the Fifth: Flying dragon in the heavens. It is beneficial to see the great man
The manifestation is "beauty" or splendor, like the sun at its zenith. This line shares similarities with the second line. This stage is again easier to operate in, with a clear "money-making effect." This is the position of the "Nine-Five Sovereign," possessing kingly qualities. If one can achieve success and withdraw gracefully at this stage, nothing could be better. Best practice is often to take gains with grace here. (Wilhelm & Baynes, Hex. 1, line 5)

6.	Top Nine: Arrogant Dragon. There is regret.
The manifestation is "arrogance" or excess. The market is extremely euphoric, but "regret" is imminent, signaling the impending reversal (Wilhelm & Baynes, 1967).

Note: The market mapping above is a practical investor’s reading of the lines; the line texts themselves come directly from standard translations (Wilhelm & Baynes, 1967/1997; Lynn, 1994).
