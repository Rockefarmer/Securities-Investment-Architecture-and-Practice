2.2.1 Concept and history of behavioral finance
The foundation of behavioral finance is psychology, primarily studying the psychological characteristics of market participants – how investors actually think and feel, not how perfectly “rational” people should behave in theory.
Early work on investor psychology goes back more than a century. In 1841, Scottish writer Charles Mackay published Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, a classic study of crowd behavior and financial manias such as the South Sea Bubble and tulip mania. In 1895, French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon published The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, which analyzes how individuals change when they become part of a crowd, and how group emotions and suggestions can override rational thought. These two books are now seen as classics in the psychology of investing and crowd behavior.
Over the last 50 years, the systematic theory of behavioral finance has gradually taken shape. Key milestones include work by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman: In 1973, they first introduced the concept of the availability heuristic, where people judge the frequency or probability of events based on how easily examples come to mind. In 1974, they proposed the representativeness heuristic (judging by similarity to a stereotype) and anchoring effect (starting from an initial number and adjusting too little), in their paper “Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.” In 1979, they introduced Prospect Theory, a new model of decision-making under risk that better matches real human behavior than standard expected-utility theory, followed by the framing effect in 1981. In 1990, through experiments, they demonstrated the existence of loss aversion and the endowment effect. In 1992, they further developed Prospect Theory, naming it Cumulative Prospect Theory, which extended the model and made it suitable for a wider range of uncertain situations.
In 1980, Richard Thaler, one of the founders of behavioral economics, formally introduced the idea of mental accounting – the way people mentally separate money into different “accounts” (current income, savings, windfall gains, etc.) and treat it differently, even though a dollar is a dollar. In 1992, Abhijit Banerjee published a simple model of herd behavior, explaining how people may ignore their own information and simply follow others. 
In 1995, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers studied the trading behavior of mutual funds and found that even professional managers show evidence of herding behavior and trend-chasing (buying high and selling low). Interestingly, Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996) showed that momentum strategies – buying past winners and selling past losers – can be profitable, which connects directly to these herding and trend-chasing patterns. In 1998, Terrance Odean documented the disposition effect: investors are inclined to “sell winners and hold losers,” realizing gains too quickly while holding onto losing positions for too long. Also in 1998, Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam developed an overconfidence theory, arguing that many investors are excessively confident in their private information, and that about 90% of investors believe they can beat the market. Their model shows how overconfidence and self-attribution bias can lead to both overreaction and underreaction in prices. 
Economist Robert Shiller has put forward the "Predictable Markets" theory, arguing that overall market trends are predictable and that stock prices show “excess volatility” relative to fundamentals, challenging the strict form of the efficient market hypothesis. His 1981 paper “Do Stock Prices Move Too Much to Be Justified by Subsequent Changes in Dividends?” is a landmark in this area. 
In 2017, Richard Thaler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for showing how limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control systematically affect individual decisions and market outcomes – essentially formalizing many ideas in behavioral finance at the highest level. 

2.2.2 The theoretical framework of behavioral finance
2.2.2.1 Markets are not perfectly efficient
Traditional finance is built on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). EMH assumes that: (i) Markets have no frictions. (ii) Investors are fully rational. (iii) All available information is quickly and correctly reflected in prices. (iv) Any mispricing is quickly removed by arbitrage, so it is impossible to systematically earn excess returns after adjusting for risk. 
Behavioral finance argues that EMH's assumptions are not entirely accurate in the real world. Market frictions (transaction costs, limits to arbitrage, short-selling constraints, funding constraints, etc) and inherent human limitations (cognitive biases and emotional reactions that lead to systematic errors) often lead to frequent mispricing in stock markets. Together, these factors mean that mispricing often appears in stock markets and may not be corrected quickly. Sometimes mispricing persists for a long time, or eliminating it carries extra risk (“limits to arbitrage”). This creates room both for excess returns and for large losses.
2.2.2.2 Limited rationality and human irrationality
Richard Thaler and other behavioral economists argue that a fully rational “economic man” does not exist in reality. Real people have: (i) limited attention and cognitive capacity, (ii) social preferences (fairness, reciprocity), and (iii) problems with self-control. People's economic behavior is inevitably influenced by irrational factors. In October 2017, Thaler won the Nobel Prize for showing how limited rationality, social preferences, and a lack of self-control systematically affect our decisions and market results. In other words, our economic behavior is inevitably influenced by “irrational” elements, and those elements matter for prices and markets, not just for individuals.

2.2.3 Prospect theory
In 1979, Tversky and Kahneman proposed prospect theory, and in 1992 they developed it further into cumulative prospect theory. This is one of the most important foundations of behavioral finance. Kahneman received the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics largely for this work. The core insights of prospect theory are: (i) Investors evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point (such as the purchase price or a mental “break-even” level), not in terms of absolute wealth. (ii) The value function is S-shaped and asymmetric: Above the reference point (gains), the curve is concave – people are risk-averse (you want to play it safe) in gains. Below the reference point (losses), the curve is convex – people become risk-seeking (you take big risks to try to win it back) when they are in the domain of losses . (iii) Loss aversion: losses “hurt” more than equivalent gains “please.” This matches what we see in real investor behavior – people dread losing much more than they enjoy winning the same amount. In simple terms: When an asset’s price is above the investor’s reference point (they feel they are in profit), they tend to avoid risk and lock in gains. When the price is below the reference point (they feel they are in a loss), they become more willing to gamble to get back to break-even.
This S-shaped utility and strong loss aversion help explain many puzzles in real markets, such as the disposition effect (selling winners too early and holding losers too long), reluctance to realize losses, and investors’ asymmetric risk attitudes.
